# Pokedex: a simple-js-app

## Objective: 
  Build a Pokedex web application using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript** code that loads data from an external **API/URL** (https://pokeapi.com/v2/pokemon) to allow viewing data points in detail.
  
  The Pokedex application displays a sample list of 150 Pokemons with information about their image, name, height, abilities and types.
  
  On user action (by clicking on an item), the user is able to interact with the application and view details for that item via pop-up window that the user can click it away when done reading it.
